    " # Getting started with granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection model hosted on Hugging Face for the segmentation of flood events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection model is a fine-tuned geospatial foundation model for detecting flood and surface water using multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery. The model predicts areas of water from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and was trained on flood events from the United Kingdom and Ireland, recorded by the [Copernicus Emergency Management service (CEMS)](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/).  Please see the [model card](../granite-geospatial-flood-detection-uki-model-card.md) for more details. The model was fine-tuned from the [granite-geospatial-uki model](../granite-geospatial-uki-model-card.md),\n",
    "this model follows the same architecture as [Prithvi-EO](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-nasa-geospatial/prithvi-for-earth-observation-6740a7a81883466bf41d93d6) and has also been released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments have shown that while granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection works best in the UK and Ireland, the base model granite-geospatial-uki can also be successfully fine-tuned for flood detection in other locations. To learn more about fine tuning the base model to other locations, please see the [fine tuning notebook](../notebooks/2_fine_tuning.ipynb), which demonstrates fine tuning and inference for Spain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to run inference using [**granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection-v1**](../granite-geospatial-flood-detection-uki-model-card.md) (which was fine tuned on UK and Ireland data) and is split into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inference: The [**granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection-v1**](../granite-geospatial-flood-detection-uki-model-card.md) model is loaded and used to run inference on test data for flood events across UK and Ireland that were not seen in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluation. We compare the model above against inference results trained using only Sentinel-2 and show the improvement in performance by incorporating Sentinel-1 data, in particular in the presence of clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note:\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the fine tuned model for UK and Ireland (granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection-v1). To use the model fine-tuned for Spain instead pleae see [2_fine_tuning-tuning.ipynb](./2_fine_tuning.ipynb).\n",

    "  The granite-geospatial-uki-flood-detection model is trained using the [Terratorch](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/) framework. Terratorch simplifies the integration of foundation model backbones into the TorchGeo framework and provides generic LightningDataModules that can be built at runtime. For more information on Terratorch, please refer to the instructions in the [Terratorch Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/blob/main/docs/quick_start.md). To set up your environments for running this notebook on Google Colab, please see section 0.1.

Some possible reasons for this could be due to not having enough of this type of scenario in the training set, or it could also be because the missing value regions are being confused with water in the model. (e.g. the right half of the middle figure, where S2 data is missing).\n",

If you wish to use only S1 data, we advise to fine-tune the granite-geospatial-uki model using S1 only data. An example on how to fine-tune using our model can be found in the notebook [2_fine_tuning.ipynb](./2_fine_tuning.ipynb). This demonstrates the use of different model configurations (config_granite_geospatial_uki_flood_detection_v2.yaml) and weights (granite_geospatial_uki_flood_detection_v2.ckpt) when carrying out fine-tuning and inference for a different region."
